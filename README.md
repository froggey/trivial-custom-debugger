# trivial-custom-debugger

This is a portability library that allows one to fully override the standard debugger provided by their Common Lisp system for situations where binding `*debugger-hook*` is not enough - most notably, for `#'break`.

Purpose: a basic building block that allows one to implement a portable, custom debugger for Common Lisp systems *in place* of the original system-provided one.

```lisp
TRIVIAL-CUSTOM-DEBUGGER> (with-debugger ((lambda (condition hook)
                                           (declare (ignore hook))
                                           (format t ";; Debugging a ~S!~%" 
                                                   (type-of condition))
                                           (throw :handled t)))
                           (list (catch :handled (error 'error))
                                 (catch :handled (break))
                                 (let ((*break-on-signals* 'error))
                                   (catch :handled (signal 'error)))
                                 (catch :handled 
                                   (invoke-debugger (make-condition 'error)))))
;; Debugging a ERROR!
;; Debugging a SIMPLE-CONDITION!
;; Debugging a SIMPLE-CONDITION!
;; Debugging a ERROR!

* The main interface is the `with-debugger` macro that accepts a hook function that would be acceptable for `*debugger-hook*` (it must accept two arguments: a condition that the debugger is invoked with and a similar hook function).
* A functional interface for the above is provided in form of `call-with-debugger`, which accepts a hook function and a zero-argument thunk.
* It is possible, though not advisable, to install a debugger function globally across the whole Lisp system. The function `install-debugger` is provided for that case. (If you want to use it, you might want to contribute a matching `uninstall-debugger` function that restores the Lisp system to the previous state.)

Very roughly tested on SBCL, CCL, ECL, Clasp, ABCL, CLISP, ACL and LispWorks. Will test it later more thoroughly, but will also accept test reports from other people.

To run the test suite, evaluate `(asdf:test-system :trivial-custom-debugger)`.
